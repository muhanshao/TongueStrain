# Tongue muscle fiber reconstruction and strain analysis

The tongue muscle fiber orientations can be reconstructed from high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) data. The strain in the line of action during speech production can be analyzed from the fiber orientations and motion fields.

## Folders and files description
 - Folder _dirdetect/_ contains tongue muscle fiber orientation reconstruction code and models.
 - Folder _bin/_ contains run scripts for the strain analysis pipeline.
 - Folder _pipeline_code_example/_ contains example scripts for how to run the strain analysis pipeline.

## Required softwares and python packages:
 - Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs)
 - Nibabel
 - DIPY
 - PyTorch
 - dwave-qbsolv
